= bb8-diesel-test

Test behavior of bb8-diesel when database queries block.  See `src/bin/starve_current_task.rs` and `src/bin/starve_executor.rs`.

== Starving the current task

https://docs.rs/bb8-diesel/0.2.0/bb8_diesel/struct.DieselConnection.html[bb8-diesel] says:

> All blocking methods within this type delegate to block_in_place.

https://docs.rs/tokio/1.10.1/tokio/task/fn.block_in_place.html[`block_in_place`] is very clear that:

> Be aware that although this function avoids starving other independently spawned tasks, any other code running concurrently in the same task will be suspended during the call to block_in_place. This can happen e.g. when using the join! macro.

This test shows that behavior using the `select!` macro, which is arguably more confusing because the user of `select!` expects it to return when the first Future has finished.  Instead, when using bb8-diesel, it will always wait for the bb8-diesel operation.  (This might be obvious if you notice that there's no `async` at all in the bb8-diesel usage.  However, a lot of uses might appear to be `async` (e.g., because they asynchronously grab a connection from the pool), but then still behave synchronously.)

Here's the output:

----
$ cargo run --bin=starve_current_task
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.04s
     Running `target/debug/starve_current_task`
TEST ONE: Issue two `tokio::time::sleep` calls using `tokio::select!`.
Expected behavior: Only the shorter sleep completes.  It takes
the expected amount of time.  (The other sleep is cancelled.)
[2] begin tokio sleep for 300ms
[1] begin tokio sleep for 500ms
[2] done tokio sleep for 300ms, slept for 302.961769ms

TEST TWO: Issue a `tokio::time::sleep` call and a database sleep call
using `tokio::select!`.
Expected behavior: We always wait the duration of the database sleep,
even though it's longer than the other sleep.
(ideal behavior: the shorter sleep completes first)
[4] begin tokio sleep for 300ms
[3] begin db sleep for 500ms
[3] database sleep for 500ms, slept for 502.600241ms

This program shows that if you use https://docs.rs/tokio/1.10.1/tokio/macro.select.html[tokio::select!] (just as an example) to run two Futures concurrently from one task, and one of those Futures is a bb8-diesel query, the other Future will be starved.  In this program, the database query sleeps (in the database) for 500ms, while the other (starved) future sleeps for 300ms with `tokio::time::sleep`.  Note that the `select!` doesn't return for 500ms, and it's the database future that finished, not the one that slept for only 300ms.


== Starving the executor

Another problem, possibly worse, is that each of these operations appears to use up a **core (worker) thread**, not a blocking thread (see https://docs.rs/tokio/1.10.1/tokio/#cpu-bound-tasks-and-blocking-code[tokio docs]).

This program issues eight tasks:

. D1: "database" task -- use bb8-diesel to issue a database query to sleep for 1s
. Q1: "quick" task -- just prints out the time since the program started
. D2: another database task
. Q2: another quick task
. D3: another database task
. Q3: another quick task
. D4: another database task
. Q4: another quick task

This program configures tokio with 4 core threads and 8 blocking threads.

In a fully asynchronous system, we'd expect to kick off all 8 tasks, and pretty soon, all four database tasks would be blocked, and all four quick tasks would have finished running.

But here's what happens:

[source,text]

----

This shows that the sequence was:

. D1 issued (and presumably blocks)
. Q1 ("intermediate task 0") issued and finishes
. D2 issued (and presumably blocks)
. Q2 ("intermediate task 1") issued and finishes
. D3 issued (and presumably blocks)
. Q3 ("intermediate task 2") issued and finishes
. D4 issued (and presumably blocks)
. One second passes
. D2 finishes, D1 finishes, and Q4 ("intermediate task 3") is issued and finishes

The smoking gun is the one second gap before "intermediate task 3" finishes.  What happens under the hood is:

. D1 issued to thread 1 -- core thread 1 is now stuck.
. Q1 issued to thread 2 and completes immediately.
. D2 issued to thread 2 -- core thread 2 is now stuck.
. Q2 issued to thread 3 and completes immediately.
. D3 issued to thread 3 -- core thread 3 is now stuck.
. Q3 issued to thread 4 and completes immediately.
. D4 issued to thread 4 -- core thread 4 is now stuck.
. Q4 is queued up.  There is no thread to run it!
. Time passes (one second).
. Any of the D1-D4 tasks finishes, frees up a thread, and Q4 runs.
